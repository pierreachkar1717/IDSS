## Structure of the project

The structure of this project is organized into several directories, each containing specific information related to the project. The main directories are:

### Data
This directory contains all the processed data used in the project. It has several sub-directories, including:

- Processed: This sub-directory contains all the pre-processed datasets used in the project. It includes the following sub-directories:
    - EDA: This sub-directory contains plots of the preprocessed datasets, which were used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    - clustering: This sub-directory contains the clustered datasets, which were used to group similar data points together. It has a sub-directory called labeled, which contains the labeled 			  datasets, which have been assigned specific labels based on their characteristics.
    - joined_data: This sub-directory contains our main databases, in different forms. The file final_table_all_info is our main table, which contains all the relevant information.
    - neighborhood: This sub-directory contains the preprocessed datasets, which have been aggregated by neighborhood.

 - Raw data: This sub-directory contains the raw data used in the project. It has the following sub-directories:
    - City: This sub-directory contains data about the city of Barcelona. 
    - Population: This sub-directory contains data about the population of Barcelona.

- recommendations: This directory contains the generated recommendations by the system, which are based on the processed data and user input.

- user_input: This directory contains the user input, which is used to generate personalized recommendations.

- barris.geojson: This file contains geo information for each neighborhood in Barcelona, which is used to display the neighborhoods on a map.

- questionaire.txt: This file contains the questionaire, which is used to gather user input.

- mapping.txt: This file contains the mapping of user input, which is used to generate personalized recommendations.


## src 
This directory contains all the source code for the project. It has several sub-directories, including:
- Clustering: This sub-directory contains the main script for clustering, as well as all the scripts used to cluster each dataset. 
- postprocessing: This sub-directory contains the scripts for merging the data, dealing with missing values, and the categorical labeling. These scripts are responsible for cleaning and preparing the data for further analysis and mapping.
- preprocessing & EDA: This sub-directory contains the scripts for the preprocessing (aggregating and plotting). 
- streamlit: This sub-directory contains the script for the application, where the mapping & matching is also happening, as well as the map and GPT integration.
